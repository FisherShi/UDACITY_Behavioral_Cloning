# UDACITY Driving Behavior Cloning Project

## The Goal of This Project
The goal of this project to use convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle in the simulator provided by Udacity.

## Summary
I used image data and steering angles collected in the simulator to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track. check _model.py_ for the code.

The project repo from Udacity can be found here

## The Model
Nvidia published an [end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) to process visual data. I applied the archetecture of the Nvidia network in this project.
